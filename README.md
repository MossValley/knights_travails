A program to calculate the movement of a chess knight from one point to another, made as part of The Odin Project's Ruby Programming course - [Project:  Knights Travails](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/knights-travails)

This project was travails itself, as it build on binary search trees (as I have dealt with [here](https://github.com/MossValley/balanced_bst)) but was slightly more complex with the possibility of 8 different children. I incorporated concepts from [this](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/describing-graphs) Khan Academy course which talks about graphs.

The program currently works by taking the knight's starting and end position from within the program itself, building a search tree around the starting position, finding the end position and tracing that node back up to the root, outputing this sequence as part of the output string. 

**Features to add**
* Taking user input from the command line
* Mapping the search tree?
